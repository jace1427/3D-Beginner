## Linear Interpolation
We used linear interpolation on the vignette Post-Processing effect, to create a flicker effect on the game. It is located in VignetteEffects.cs in the scripts folder.

## Dot Product
We used a Dot Product to make the Gargoyle enenmy types follow the player around as they traverse the world.

## Particle Effects
We attached Particle Effects to all of the Ghost enemies in the game. The Particles are indepent of the Ghost, small and short lived.
